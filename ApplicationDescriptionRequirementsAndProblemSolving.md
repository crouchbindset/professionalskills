## Description of the Application
The application is a prototype of a Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality playspace with the purpose of facilitating interaction and play between its users.

## Problem being Solved
The application aims to provide an augmented reality playspace which will allow autistic users to play and interact more easily with others. People, in particular children, with autism can find it hard to interact and socialise with their peers, our augmented reality playspace aims to provide an enviroment which allows users to more easily overcome these challenges.

## Requirements
The application must be suitable for our target audience and have a clear targeted problem to solve. The playspace needs to incorporate augmented reality technology, in particular the Microsoft HoloLens using Unity as a development enviroment. 

The applications prototype will need to run on an Android mobile device and providing similar functionality to the HoloLens in order to properly demonstrate our playspace.
