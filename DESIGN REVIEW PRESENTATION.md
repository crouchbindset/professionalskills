# Design Review (2-page explanation and a presentation) 5

This is a 10-minute presentation to the whole class of your team's design followed by brief questions.

Providing that content is relevant, the assessment will concentrate on the presentation skills displayed, that is: 

1. The organisation of the material
2. Appropriate use of the available time
3. The use of simple, clear slides, and the style of delivery.

Your team must submit your slides/script prior to the presentation session.
