## Deadlines: 

### 8th March: Literature review and ethical issues report. 

#### Literature Review (max 5 pages)

You are to conduct a literature review investigating the academic research that has been carried out using AR as an assistive technology. In your search you can look at impairment in general.

You do not need to focus your search on autism or visual impairment, but these impairments should be discussed if appropriate.  
Your review should focus on peer-reviewed research published in high quality journals or conferences.

#### Ethical Issues Report (max 2 pages)

While AR technologies are not new, today’s AR technologies are as capable as they have ever been and are only just becoming available at consumer level.

As a result, developing AR applications highlights several ethical and legal considerations.

You are to produce a report highlighting the key ethical concerns that need to be considered when developing AR technologies. 

All material and ideas from other authors must be cited in the text and referenced at the end of the article (references do not count to your page limit) using Harvard referencing (http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm). 

### 5th April: Design review. 

### 1st May: Software demonstration, critical review and signed records.

## Brief Summary 

This project requires you to apply the project management techniques discussed in the first semester and a selection of the material studied in your other second year modules to a development project. 

You are part of a development team that wishes to explore the potential of emerging Augmented Reality (AR) technologies for use as an assistive technology. More specifically your team is interested in how AR technologies can be used to help young people of different capabilities play together in a physical play space. You are to create a prototype of an ‘Augmented Play Space’ that helps people with different capabilities play together in the physical world. Your team may choose the play spaces topic/game(s)/subject matter. 

You may focus the design of your augmented play space prototype to support one of two different user groups. You may choose either: 

1. ~~People with visual impairment~~
2. **People with autism**

The prototype should seek to address some of the typical difficulties these user groups face when playing with other people. You should consider what digital augmentations can be made to a physical play space, the people in it or the physical items/toys used during play to help your chosen user group play with other people more effectively. The AR technology you will be developing for is detailed below.
