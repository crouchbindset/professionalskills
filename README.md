## Deadlines : 

### 5th April: Design review. 

#### Design Review and Presentation (2 pages)

This is a 10-minute presentation to the whole class of your team's design followed by brief questions.

Providing that content is relevant, the assessment of this review will concentrate on the presentation skills displayed, that is:

1. The organisation of the material
2. Appropriate use of the available time
3. The use of simple, clear slide
4. The style of delivery

*Your team must submit your slides/script prior to the presentation session.*

### 1st May: Software demonstration, critical review and signed records.

#### Demonstration of Software

During the scheduled lab session, you will be required to give a demonstration of your finished application to the module tutor and a moderator. During the demonstration you will be questioned on your implementation and project management.

#### Evaluative Critical Review (max 4 pages)

This is a review of your processes and product(s), which should identify any problems with either and discuss (i.e. consider alternatives and justify choices) what you could have done to improve your work.

Among other things, the review should discuss:

1. The effectiveness of your project management and potential alternatives

2. Any deficiencies in your design uncovered during implementation or review

3. Recommendations for commercial implementation

4. Any alternatives in the light of your implementation experience

Whether or not you have fixed any deficiencies in the implementation, you will receive credit for identifying problems and suggesting improvements.

#### A subset of records signed during the development (max 10 pages)

You must submit at least 10 weekly team records. Your team should keep electronic or paper records, (but they must be accessible on demand):

##### Part 1: Descriptive information

1. Meeting times & attendance

2. Decisions taken

3. Agreed actions (identifying who is responsible for the action and deadline)

4. Design sketches

5. References to books, web-sites or journals

6. Confirmation that tasks have been completed to an appropriate level

7. Fault reports

8. Change management information (change requests and authorisation)

##### Part 2: Quantitative information

A record of activities and durations, with a summary of time spent on different activities.

The time logs should be sufficiently detailed to account for the time spent on the task, simply recording *'5 hours spent researching AR libraries'* does not contain enough detail for how the time was spent.

## Brief Summary 

This project requires you to apply the project management techniques discussed in the first semester and a selection of the material studied in your other second year modules to a development project. 

You are part of a development team that wishes to explore the potential of emerging Augmented Reality (AR) technologies for use as an assistive technology.

More specifically your team is interested in how AR technologies can be used to help young people of different capabilities play together in a physical play space.

You are to create a prototype of an ‘Augmented Play Space’ that helps people with different capabilities play together in the physical world. Your team may choose the play spaces topic/game(s)/subject matter. 

You may focus the design of your augmented play space prototype to support one of two different user groups. You may choose either: 

1. ~~People with visual impairment~~
2. **People with autism**

The prototype should seek to address some of the typical difficulties these user groups face when playing with other people. You should consider what digital augmentations can be made to a physical play space, the people in it or the physical items/toys used during play to help your chosen user group play with other people more effectively. The AR technology you will be developing for is detailed below.
