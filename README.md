You can use this [Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for an overview of the markdown language used in GitHub .md files, useful for creating GitHub README files and documentation.

## Deadlines: 

### 8th March: Literature review and ethical issues report. 

#### Literature Review (max 5 pages)

You are to conduct a literature review investigating the academic research that has been carried out using AR as an assistive technology. In your search you can look at impairment in general.

You do not need to focus your search on autism or visual impairment, but these impairments should be discussed if appropriate.  
Your review should focus on peer-reviewed research published in high quality journals or conferences.

#### Ethical Issues Report (max 2 pages)

While AR technologies are not new, today’s AR technologies are as capable as they have ever been and are only just becoming available at consumer level.

As a result, developing AR applications highlights several ethical and legal considerations.

You are to produce a report highlighting the key ethical concerns that need to be considered when developing AR technologies. 

All material and ideas from other authors must be cited in the text and referenced at the end of the article (references do not count to your page limit) using Harvard referencing (http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm). 

### 5th April: Design review. 

### 1st May: Software demonstration, critical review and signed records.

## Brief Summary 

This project requires you to apply the project management techniques discussed in the first semester and a selection of the material studied in your other second year modules to a development project. 

You are part of a development team that wishes to explore the potential of emerging Augmented Reality (AR) technologies for use as an assistive technology. More specifically your team is interested in how AR technologies can be used to help young people of different capabilities play together in a physical play space. You are to create a prototype of an ‘Augmented Play Space’ that helps people with different capabilities play together in the physical world. Your team may choose the play spaces topic/game(s)/subject matter. 

You may focus the design of your augmented play space prototype to support one of two different user groups. You may choose either: 

1. People with visual impairment 
2. People with autism 

The prototype should seek to address some of the typical difficulties these user groups face when playing with other people. You should consider what digital augmentations can be made to a physical play space, the people in it or the physical items/toys used during play to help your chosen user group play with other people more effectively. The AR technology you will be developing for is detailed below.

### ~~8th February: Project proposal.~~

#### ~~Project Proposal (max 4 pages)~~

~~The proposal is not marked but will help you to think about what you are doing and should be useful when you come to do the evaluative critical review.~~

~~The final year individual project proposal form will be available on Blackboard. However, just pick the bits you think are useful and add in the project management information, because you are working as a team. It must contain two parts:~~

##### ~~Part 1: Application Information~~

~~1. Description of the application, problem being solved, requirements.~~

~~2. Brief description of what the system will do.~~

~~3. Statement of the key risks.~~

##### ~~Part 2: Project Management Information~~

~~Key features of the way you will be working in order to avoid:~~

### ~~22nd February: User analysis and technical plan.~~

#### ~~User Analysis (max 2 pages)~~

~~It is important to understand your chosen user group and the challenges they face when playing with other people. This report should investigate and identify the key barriers your chosen users face because of their impairment, and what approaches are currently used to overcome these challenges. You may discuss some more general issues related to the person’s impairment, but there should also be a focus on the challenges faced during play. In the report there should be four main sections.~~

~~1. Types of impairment experienced by your chosen user group.~~

~~2. Challenges this presents to the users.~~

~~3. Challenges this presents during play.~~

~~4. Current approaches to addressing these challenges.~~

#### ~~Technical Plan (max 5 pages)~~

~~In this report you describe all key technical elements of the development.~~

~~1. Description of the application demonstrating initial investigation.~~

~~2. Envisaged usage scenarios.~~

~~3. Outline User Interface/Interaction Designs for your AR application.~~

~~4. Evaluation of alternative potential approaches.~~

~~5. Investigation methods, development lifecycle and application structure.~~

~~6. Implementation approaches.~~

~~7. Outline of proposed solution to allow feasibility to be assessed.~~

~~8. Any significant risks and actions to avoid, reduce or tackle them.~~

~~9. Estimate of how much the project will cost.~~ 

~~10. Worker time, cost per day and overheads.~~ 

~~11. Commercial software license costs.~~

~~12. Team processes and operational procedures.~~

~~1. People being told unexpectedly at the end that their work is rubbish.~~

~~2. People not having enough/having too much to do or not being involved.~~

~~3. No one knowing where the latest version of the software is.~~ 

~~4. A disk crash destroying all copies of the software.~~ 

~~5. Someone changing the interface between components without agreement.~~ 

~~6. The group falling behind without noticing.~~ 

~~7. Everyone interpreting an agreement in a different way.~~ 

~~8. Not having a demonstrable system by the deadline.~~
