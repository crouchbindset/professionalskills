How we will avoid people being told unexpectedly at the end that their work is rubbish:

By ensuring that each member of the team has their progress frequently peer reviewed and monitored using periodic stand-up meetings and pair programming. This will allow each member to be provided with supportive feedback and constructive criticism on the task that they are assigned to. 

How we will avoid people not having enough/having too much to do or not being involved:

By employing the use of a Kanban board that can show the level of work being assigned to each member. This allows for the entire team to be aware of what each other is expected to do. We will also have some time in each of our meetings for any issues with workload to be discussed with each other if any members of the team feel they are doing too much or too little.
